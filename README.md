In this repository I present the app Tealfeeds (formerly Jeptek news). Sadly I can't publish the code as we want it to be private.

Note that the project is still in developement.

# Tealfeeds

Tealfeeds is an app which fetches you all the latest news from several different news sources. The apps users can vote wether the article is good or bad based on the articles quality. Based on user interactions the app can filter hot news, best news, debated news and latest news (latest will be merged to hot in upcoming changes). The app also filters the news based on several topics such as Global, Economics, Science, Local (based on location), etc.

# Preview
### New concept art
We decided to redesign the whole UI as the first concept art I made was hard to transfer to mobile (shadows and blendingmodes didn't look the same).
The new UI is focused on being clean, simple and feel more open.

### Current feed screen

### Current menu tab
On top of the menu tab users picture, name and email should be displayed. However after current reworks on the project structure those have bugged.

From profile user can change their picture, name or biography.
From notifications user can see recent activity on their comments or replies.
From comments user can see their comments.
From replies user can see their replies.
Settings have not been implemented yet.

### Current article view
The bar on bottom hides on scroll.
User can vote on the articles quality and go to comments.

### Current comment feed
As of current changes commenting won't work anymore but the former concept art will give the idea pretty well.

# My contribution

The project is originally started by my friend Joona Parjanen. At some point I hopped in and started working on frontend.

I have mostly worked on the frontend side of the project as Joona manages the backend. All designs and implementations are made by me with React-native.
